# Shell Commands & CTF Commands

This little project is a collection of shell commands that I find pretty useful, especially if you're a Computer Science student or someone who enjoys playing with Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges.

Inside, you'll find a shell script called `commands.sh`. It's basically a cheat sheet with a bunch of commands, from everyday file navigation and text manipulation to more specific tools used in CTFs for things like forensics, web exploitation, and reverse engineering etc....

## How to Use

1.  Clone this repository (or just download the `commands.sh` file).
2.  Open the script in a text editor to read through the commands and search through the internet if not understood.
3.  Best way to learn is by doing! Open your terminal and try running some of them. Use `man <command_name>` to get more detailed information about any specific command.

Remember to practice these commands

Happy shelling!
